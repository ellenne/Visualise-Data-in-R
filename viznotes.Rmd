# Instalation of the packages needed for the work

```{r setupFirst}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)
library(gapminder)
```

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
my_packages <- c("tidyverse", "broom", "coefplot","cowplot",
                 "gapminder", "GGally", "ggrepel", 
                 "ggridges", "gridExtra", "interplot",
                 "margins", "maps", "mapproj", "mapdata",
                 "MASS", "quantreg", "scales", "survey",
                 "srvyr", "viridis", "viridisLite",
                 "devtools")

install.packages(my_packages,
                 repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
```

## one other special package is required


```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("kjhealy/socviz")
library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)
```

# Basics of the R language

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25)
```

```{r}
my_numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25)
your_numbers <- c(5, 31, 71, 1, 3, 21, 6)

```

## There is a shortcut for the assignment operator that is ## ALT + -

## Functions
```{r}
mean(x = my_numbers)
mean(x = your_numbers)
my_summary <- summary(my_numbers)
table(my_numbers)
sd(my_numbers)
my_numbers * 2 
my_numbers + 1
my_numbers + my_numbers
```

## You can always ask the class

```{r}
class(my_numbers)
class(my_summary)
class(summary)
```


The class of the R objects can change as per below:

```{r}
my_new_vector <- c(my_numbers, "Apple")
my_new_vector
class(my_new_vector)
```

Note that in my_new_vector the numbers became characters therefore they cannot be used as they are to make calculations. They need to be converted back into numbers.

# Data Frame

```{r}
titanic
```
```{r}
class(titanic)
```


In order to access to the data frame variables we use the dollar operator ($)

```{r}
titanic$percent
```

# To see inside an object
 
The str function is very useful

```{r}
str(my_numbers)
str(my_summary)
```

Let's start

```{r}
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```

```{r chart_01.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point()
```

## Let's look at the data

```{r}
data(anscombe)
library(gapminder)
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder)
```

We know the data but not the mapping 

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))
```

The geometry is missing and we add it like that 

```{r chart_02.jpeg}
p + geom_point()
```

We can add a trend line like that :

```{r chart_03.jpeg}
p + geom_smooth()
```
![Figure 3](figures\Chart_03.png)

Only the line is showed. If I want to show the points and the line, I have to put both in my chart like this:

```{r chart_04.jpeg}
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```
![Figure 4](figures\Chart_04.png)

The function of the trend has been automatically chose by R. If I want to specify the function as a line I can do the following:

```{r chart_05.jpeg}
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
![Figure 5](figures\Chart_05.png)
If I want to change the scale and instead of plot x and y I want to plot them on a Log10 scale I can do the following (first version is the explicit declaration then a function is used)

```{r chart_06.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = log10(gdpPercap),
                          y = lifeExp)
            )
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam")
```
In the case above the GAM function is used in the smooth. This is used to fit a Generalized Additive Model.

That should be equivalent to this:


```{r chart_07.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp)
            )
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
  scale_x_log10()
```
The only difference is in the scale. Above I had the value of the Log. In the second case instead I have the value de-logged.

Other useful transformation can be the following:

scale_x_sqrt()
scale_x_reverse()

Let's try them both:

```{r chart_08.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp)
            )
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
  scale_x_sqrt()
```

```{r chart_09.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp)
            )
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
  scale_x_reverse()
```

If we haven't loaded a library and we want to use a component of that library we use the following syntax thelibrary::thefunction as in the below:

```{r chart_10.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar)
```
A part from scales::dollar we have other function that we can use such as scale::commas that we will try here below:

```{r chart_11.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma)
```

Now we can add more variables to our plot. Let's see how:

```{r chart_12.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp,
                          color = continent))

p + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + 
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar)

```
The plot is very difficult to read and also there are 5 smoothers, one foreach continent. 
This was my own plot, the book did not trace it.

Let's go back to what the book trace:

```{r chart_13.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp,
                          color = "purple"))
p + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
    scale_x_log10()
```
The legend there is because we added the colour in the wrong place. Putting it into the aes R reclycle the string, makes it a vector on the fly so a new dimension is created similar to what happened before with the continent. 

Remember that the purple is the colour of the points so let's put it in the right place as below:

```{r chart_14.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point(color = "purple") +
    geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
    scale_x_log10()
```
Attributes that are not typical of the mapping of the plot do not go inside the aes function. Here below we set some parameters belonging to smooth function. The se function switches of the standard error around the trend line. The size is very high (to have a very thick line) and the method is lm.
Note that all these have been specified within the smooth outside the mapping that is concerned just with what it has to be mapped on the chart (the coordinates of the points)

```{r chart_15.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_smooth(color = "orange", se = FALSE, size = 8,
                method = "lm")+
    scale_x_log10()
```

Now we can make a polished plot

```{r chart_16.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, 
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "gam") + 
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(x = "GDP Per Capita",
         y = "Life Expectancy in Years",
         title = "Economic Growth and Life Expectancy",
         subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
         caption = "Source: Gapminder.")
```

We can add in our chart the information about the Continent as well:

```{r chart_17.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp,
                          color = continent,
                          fill = continent))
p + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
    scale_x_log10()
```
The problem with the chart above is that is very confused. We have 5 lines that are a little bit too many. 

We can avoid it. Maybe just one line would be enough.
This happens because the geom_ functions inherit the mapping from the ggplot function that is in the layer above. But we can modify this redefying the mapping in the geom_ as well.

So we will not specify the color and fill in the ggplot function but in the geom_ we will say that we want the points colored by continent in this way:

```{r Chart_18.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = continent)) +
    geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar)
```

It is possible to map continuous variables to colors as well. Note that the continent is a discrete or categorical variables (that assumes a small number of values). 
We are going to see it with Population (pop). It is better to cut a continuous variable into bins rather than using a colour.

```{r Chart_19.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = pop)) +
    scale_x_log10()
```

# Group, facets and transform

## Group

We want to plot the trajectory of life expectancy over time for each contry. We want to see that as years pass life expectancy increases. Year will be our X variable and lifeExp Y. 

```{r Chart_20.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year,
                          y = gdpPercap))
p + geom_line()
```
This is not what we expected. Our data are for each contry, so we need to tell this to ggplot.
What ggplot is doing is the following: it finds a series of year observations (e.g 1952 Afganistan, 1952 USA, 1952 Italy) and put them all together. So it seems that we do not have some numbers of observations by each year.

When ggplot gives a chart that is wrong but without an error being produced it means that there is a mismatch between the data and the aesthetics for the geometry being used. Therefore in the geom_ we need to redefine, customize the aesthetics in order for R doing what we want.

```{r Chart_21.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year,
                          y = gdpPercap))
p + geom_line(aes(group = country))
```

The outlier is Kuwait.

The previous with the previous plot was that ggplot could not know that the year was grouped by country and this is what we tell in the geom_ aesthetic.

Similar we can do:

```{r Chart_22.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_line(aes(group = country))
```

## Facet

The charts above are powerful but they are pretty unreadable. So we can use facets, produce many little charts that we put back to back or organise in a matrix to highlight differences.

Facets is not a geom_ but a way to organise geometries. We use facet_wrap. Many arguments can be used but the most important is the first one - the R formula which use the tilde char ~

```{r Chart_23.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year,
                          y = gdpPercap))
p + geom_line(aes(group = country)) +
    facet_wrap(~ continent)
```
Let's try to put all in one line with the trend line in each plot

```{r Chart_24.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap))
p + geom_line(color = "gray70", aes(group = country)) +
    geom_smooth(size = 1.1, method = "loess", se = FALSE) +   scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
    facet_wrap(~ continent, ncol = 5) +
    labs(x = "Year",
         y = "GDP per capita",
         title = "GDP per capita on Five Continents")
  
```
Facets can do more that that. It is possible to cross-classify some data by two categorical variables. In this case you use facet_grid(). The plot will be laid in a true two-dimensional arrangement.

We can see this on the diamonds dataset

```{r Chart_25.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, 
            mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
p + geom_smooth(alpha = 0.3) +
    facet_grid(cut ~ color)
```
We have 2 variables the cut (fair, good, fairy good, premium, ideal) and the color (D, E, F, G, H, I, J). For each of the 35 combinations facet_grid makes a chart of the carat vs price.

Further CATEGORICAL variables can be added (e.g cut ~ color + clarity)
There is a difference if you write the formula like that cut ~ color or ~ cut + color

```{r Chart_26.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, 
            mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
p + geom_smooth(alpha = 0.3) +
    facet_grid(~ cut + color)
```

## Geom

Every geom_ function has an associated stat_ function that it uses by default

```{r Chart_27.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = continent))
p + geom_bar()
```
The chart above represent the count by continent of the points. This is because the bar has the stat_count as default.

We need to notice that the y-axis contains the variable 'count' that is not in the data. Ggplot is counting the couple year-country for us automatically. This is done using the stat_ function associated with it in this case stat_count(). This function has computed 2 new vars count and prop (proportion).
stat_count is used by default by geom_bar()

```{r Chart_28a.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = continent))
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = ..prop..))
```

The .. before and after the variable names is to make sure these variables are not confused with others that can possibly exist.

We are trying to make a chart with the proportion of observations per country. What is happening with the chart above is that the denominator is the number of observation by contient, that's why it is always giving us 100%. It is the opposite problem of the grouping because we need to tell R to consider as denominator the total number of observations. So we need to tell ggplot to ignore the x category when calculating the denominator of the proportion and use the total. 
We do that using group = 1 inside the aes call. 1 is a dummy value to say to use the whole dataset when establishing the denominator for the proportion

```{r Chart_28.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = continent))
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

In order to show other function of geom_bar we will use another dataset containing more categorical variables.
This is the General Social Survey (GSS). It is in the socviz package. We see the results of the question what is your religion:

```{r}
table(gss_sm$religion)
```

We want a bar chart coloured by religion. So religion should be in the fill. 

```{r Chart_29.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm,
            mapping = aes(x = religion, color = religion))
p + geom_bar()
```

We need to remember that mapping religion to color will just give the color to the external shape but the inside will stay gray. If we want to fill we need to use fill 

```{r Chart_30.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm,
            mapping = aes(x= religion, fill = religion))
p + geom_bar() + guides(fill = FALSE)
```
guides(fill = FALSE) helps the name not to go one over the other. Also the legend is removed. The legend is there because we mapped the same variable (religion) on 2 aesthetics (x and color/fill).

The fill aesthetics can be used to show 2 variables at once.
The dataset has another variable called big region that can be broken down by religion in this way:

```{r Chart_31.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm,
            mapping = aes(x = bigregion, fill = religion))
p + geom_bar()
```

It is difficult to see the position of the Catholics in the different regions therefore we can do as follow:

```{r Chart_32.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm,
            mapping = aes(x = bigregion, fill = religion))
p + geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

If we want stacked bars we use dodge:

```{r Chart_33.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm,
            mapping = aes(x = bigregion, fill = religion))
p + geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

We loose the proportion because the count takes over so we can use the very same trick we used above:

```{r Chart_34.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm,
            mapping = aes(x = bigregion, fill = religion))
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = ..prop..),
             position = "dodge")
```

We need to say that the denominator of the proportion should be the total and not what there is in the bigregion. We do that using group. We want that the sum of the percentages in each bigregion is 100% so religion should be the variable we group by in order to calculate the proportions.

```{r Chart_35.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm,
            mapping = aes(x = bigregion, fill = religion))
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = ..prop.., group = religion),
             position = "dodge")
```

The above is not quite right because the objective was not achieved. In fact if you sum the percentages within big region you do not get to 100% but you get to 100% if you sum the same religion across the big regions. This is what we said when we said group = religion (if catholics are 100 across the 4 regions give me the percentage). We should group by 2 things, the religion and the big region. So if I have 100 in the Northeast and 50 are catholic is do 50/100. 
```{r}
table(gss_sm$bigregion, gss_sm$religion)
```

If we want to calculate the percentages, there is some work to do but eventually we arrive there:
```{r }
t1 <- table(gss_sm$bigregion, gss_sm$religion)
t2 <- as.matrix(prop.table(t1, 2))


t3 <- matrix(data = sprintf("%.1f %%", 100*t2), ncol = 5, nrow = 4)
row.names(t3) <- rownames(t2)
colnames(t3) <- colnames(t2)
t3
```

Let's work with our data to have the right numbers to plot:
```{r}
rel_by_region <- gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>% 
  summarise(N = n()) %>% 
  mutate(freq = N / sum(N),
         pct = round((freq*100),1))
rel_by_region
```

In order to check if we got the calculation right, the percentage in each region should amount to 100%. We can check if this is the case with the following code:

```{r}
rel_by_region %>% 
  group_by(bigregion) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(pct))
```
Now we can do our plot:

```{r Chart_36.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(rel_by_region, aes(x = bigregion, y = pct, fill = religion))
p + geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    labs(x = "Region", y = "Percent", fill = "Religion") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```
Not all times we need to transform data. When we do not have we can plot them directly like the example below that uses the aggregated data from the Titanic. We could use geom_bar(stat = "identity") but a shorter alternative is geom_col let's see:

```{r Chart_37.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = titanic,
            mapping = aes(x = fate, y = percent, fill = sex))
p + geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```

The position argument can be used in both geom_bar() and geom_col(). It can also take the value of "identity". stat="identity" means don't do any summary calculations
position = "identity" means just plot the values as given.
This allows us to plot a flow of positive and negative values in a bar charts. We see that with some CO2 concentration data.

```{r Chart_38.jpeg}
head(maunaloa)
p <- ggplot(data = maunaloa,
            mapping = aes(x = date, y = diff, fill = pos))
p + geom_col() + guides(fill = FALSE)
```

We used geom_col() that is very good and short. If we used geom_bar we should have specified the argument position in the following way geom_bar(position = "identity"). The guides function with fill = FALSE drops the legend.

## Transform Histograms and Density Plots

When we have a continuous variable plotting in a histogram is not the smartest thing to do. We can transform the variable making the chart more meaningful. We will work with the dataset midwest coming with ggplot that contains country data for the midwest region of the US. 

```{r Chart_39.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area))
p + geom_histogram()
```

```{r Chart_40.jpeg}
p <-  ggplot(data = midwest,
             mapping = aes(x = area))
p + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

```{r Chart_41.jpeg}
OH.WI <- c("OH", "WI")

p <- ggplot(data = subset(midwest, subset = state %in% OH.WI),
            mapping = aes(x = percollege, fill = state))
p + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.4, bins = 20)
```

Above we are comparing the distribution of two of the states that we chose. 

When we work with continuous variable an alternative to bins is a kernel density estimate of the underlying distribution. The function geom_density() does that for us:

```{r Chart_42.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area))
p + geom_density()
```

```{r Chart_43.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area, fill = state, color = state))
p + geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
```
We can ask geom_density to return some statistics such as:
- ..density.. 
- ..scaled.. (proportional density scaled to a max of 1)
- ..count.. (density times the number of points)

```{r Chart_44.jpeg}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(midwest, subset = state %in% OH.WI),
            mapping = aes(x = area, fill = state, color = state))
p + geom_density(alpha = 0.3, mapping = (aes(y = ..scaled..)))
```

# Work with Geom

We will do 3 things now:

1) Learn more geoms
2) Explore more ggplot arguments departing from defaults
3) Layering geometries

We will use a new dataset that we will explore. Instead of using head we will use another command that gives us a random sample of the data:

```{r}
organdata %>% select(1:6) %>% sample_n(size = 10)
```

We decided to explore just 6 columns of this dataset.
Let's do some basic chart to know our data:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x = year, y = donors))
p + geom_point()
```

If we want to make exploration by county:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x = year, y = donors))
p + geom_line(aes(group = country)) + facet_wrap(~ country)
```

## Boxplot

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x = country, y = donors))
p + geom_boxplot()
```

We are analysing the numbers of donors, regardeless of the year, by country. Clearly there are some countries that have more and others that have less. Note that neither year nor the population or density is considered at this stage.

The chart is not readable, swapping the x axis with the y axis will solve the problem :

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x= country, y = donors))
p + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
```

Note that swapping x with y in the first chart does not work. It does not give the whisker, just a line that is meaningless. 

Now we would like to sort the data from the highest to the lowest. In order to accomplish this we use reorder. We need to keep in mind that because of the NA we need to use the function to exclude them.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x = reorder(country, donors, na.rm = TRUE),
                          y = donors))
p + geom_boxplot() +
    labs(x = NULL) +
    coord_flip()
```

The violin plot can be an alternative but not in this case because there are too many rows.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x = reorder(country, donors, na.rm = TRUE),
                          y = donors))
p + geom_violin() +
    labs(x = NULL) +
    coord_flip()
```

We can colour our original plot in the following way:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x = reorder(country, donors, na.rm=TRUE),
                          y = donors, fill = world))
p + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = NULL) +
    coord_flip() + theme(legend.position = "top")
```

Since in our case we have not a lot of points we can have a look at the individual points in this way:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x = reorder(country, donors, na.rm = TRUE),
                          y = donors, color = world))
p + geom_point() + labs(x=NULL) +
    coord_flip() + theme(legend.position = "top")
```

Compared to before we do not use fill but we use color because the points do not have a fill unlike the box plot.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = organdata,
            mapping = aes(x = reorder(country, donors, na.rm = TRUE),
                          y = donors, color = world))
p + geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width=0.015)) + labs(x=NULL) +
    coord_flip() + theme(legend.position = "top")
                          
```
